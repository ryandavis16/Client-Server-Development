Overview

This repository includes the final dashboard code and the CRUD Python module that connects to the animal data for Grazioso Salvare. The dashboard displays and filters data from the AAC animal shelter database, making it easier to manage and find dogs that could be trained for rescue work.

Reflection
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs

I focused on writing code that is simple to understand and easy to update. Each function has a clear purpose, and I used comments to describe what different parts of the program do. The CRUD Python module separates database operations from the dashboard, which helps keep the project organized. If the database changes later, I only need to adjust the module instead of the whole program. This setup makes the code flexible and reusable for other projects that need similar database functions.

Problem-solving approach

When I start solving a problem, I try to understand what the client really needs before jumping into the code. For Grazioso Salvare, I looked at how they wanted to view and search their animal data. I tested my database queries in MongoDB Compass before connecting them to the dashboard to make sure everything worked correctly. Compared to earlier courses, this project made me think more about how the front end and back end communicate. In the future, I will keep breaking big problems into smaller steps, plan my database design carefully, and test as I go to make sure I meet client goals.

What computer scientists do and why it matters

Computer scientists create tools that make work easier and solve real problems. In this case, my project helps an organization that trains rescue dogs. The dashboard saves time by helping staff quickly find the right dogs for training. It shows how technology can support important missions and make a real difference in peopleâ€™s lives.
